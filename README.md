# secretary-problem
 To solve the secretary problem in an alternative manner, with the intention of finding a "good enough" candidate.
<p> The secretary problem, also known as the "best choice" problem, is a classic problem in probability and statistics that involves finding the best candidate from a pool of applicants. The problem is typically solved using a mathematical approach that involves calculating the probability of selecting the best candidate at each stage of the process.</p>

<p> In this code, the solve_secretary_problem() function takes a list of candidates and a threshold value as input, and returns the best candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold. The function uses a loop to iterate over the candidates, and updates the best candidate and best so far values at each step. If the best so far value reaches or exceeds the threshold, the function returns the best so far value. Otherwise, it returns the best candidate value.</p>

You can test the function by calling it with different lists of candidates and threshold values, and see how the results vary.
